# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data and Python.  
This repository contains the data analysis, model training, and evaluation steps used to build a predictive model.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses a heart disease dataset to train a machine learning model that can classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on input features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

The goal is to demonstrate a complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and exploration, to model training and evaluation.
